## Kun Universe

This simulation suite is designed for the emulator construction of China Space Station Telescope ([CSST Emulator](https://csst-emulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).
Kun is a mythological creature in Chinese culture, which is a giant fish and can become a huge bird on the sky.
Here, we named our simulation suite as **Kun Universe**, highlighting the size and variability of the simulation suite.
The cosmological parameter space are shown as followed:

| Parameter | Lower Limit | Upper Limit |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| $\Omega_b$          | 0.04  | 0.06    |
| $\Omega_{cb}$       | 0.24  | 0.40    |
| $H_0$               | 60    | 80      |
| $n_s$               | 0.92  | 1.00    |
| $A_s\times 10^{9}$  | 1.7   | 2.5     |
| $w$                 | -1.3  | -0.7    |
| $w_a$               | -0.5  | 0.5     |
| $\sum M_{\nu}$      | 0     | 0.3     |
